     * Thanks to Interitance;
     we get rid of code duplication,
     maintenance is easy,
     child classes are more atomic.

     Child class objects can use method and variables in parent class, but parent class can not use method and variables in child class.
     In Java there is no multiple inheritance, Java supports Single Inheritance and Multilevel Inheritance.
     Multilevel inheritance means Each parent can have a parent but Object class.
